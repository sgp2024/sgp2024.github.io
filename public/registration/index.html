**[Registration for the Conference and Graduate School is not open yet.](https://sgp2024.github.io/)**

**[SGP&#39;24 Program is in preparation.](/program)**
___

SGP is the premier venue for disseminating new research ideas and cutting-edge results in geometry processing. In this research area, concepts from mathematics, computer science, and engineering are studied and applied to offer new insights and design efficient algorithms for acquisition, modeling, analysis, manipulation, simulation and other types of processing of 3D models and shape collections.

Continuing a successful tradition from previous years, SGP will also offer a Graduate School, targeted at students and researchers new to the field. Courses will be taught by leading experts and complemented by interactive demonstrations to provide in-depth knowledge of recent and fundamental aspects of geometry processing.
___

**The SGP will be located at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA.**

<h2 id="registration">Registration</h2>
<p>The registration includes access to full conference program, graduate school, and social events. Free coffee mug (while supplies last) to early bird registrants. Additional mug can be purchased on-site for $15.</p>
<h3 id="rates">Rates</h3>
<p>Please format your article using the template for SGP available on the SRMv2 website: <a href="https://srmv2.eg.org">https://srmv2.eg.org</a>. SGP does not impose a strict maximum length for submitted papers. However, Computer Graphics Forum and SGP recommend that research papers be up to 10 pages (including all images, but excluding references). Papers should only be as long as their content would justify. Reviewers might rate a submission lower if it is perceived as being unnecessarily long. Authors are encouraged to use supplementary documents to provide extra content.</p>
