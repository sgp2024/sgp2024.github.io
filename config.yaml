    SGP is the premier venue for
    disseminating new research ideas and cutting-edge results in geometry
    processing. In this research area, concepts from mathematics, computer science,
    and engineering are studied and applied to offer new insights and design
    efficient algorithms for acquisition, modeling, analysis, manipulation,
    simulation and other types of processing of 3D models and shape collections.

    
    Continuing a successful tradition from previous years, SGP will also offer a 
    Graduate School, targeted at students and researchers new 
    to the field. Courses will be taught by leading experts and complemented by 
    interactive demonstrations to provide in-depth knowledge of recent and 
    fundamental aspects of geometry processing.

    **The SGP will be located at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA.**
