The Symposium on Geometry Processing (SGP)  will co-locate in a joint event of the major conferences in applied geometry at the **[International Geometry Summit 2023 (IGS’23)](https://igs2023.imati.cnr.it/)**.

SGP is the premier venue for disseminating new research ideas and cutting-edge results in geometry processing. In this research area, concepts from mathematics, computer science, and engineering are studied and applied to offer new insights and design efficient algorithms for acquisition, modeling, analysis, manipulation, simulation and other types of processing of 3D models and shape collections.

Continuing a successful tradition from previous years, SGP will also offer a Graduate School, targeted at students and researchers new to the field. Courses will be taught by leading experts and complemented by interactive demonstrations to provide in-depth knowledge of recent and fundamental aspects of geometry processing.
___
Dear all,

in the end, we found a location for the SGP summer school in the city centre of Genoa, which is more comfortable to be reached by public transportation (particularly on Saturday and Sunday when the area of the city where the CNR is located is much less served by public transport).

It is also within walking distance from the rest of the IGS event (and one stop from the underground).

**The SGP will be located at the Bi.Bi Service - EventiGenova - Via XX Settembre, 41/3rd floor, 16121 Genova (GE)**

    <h3><span class=keynote-title>The Character of Computer Animation Research</span></h3>
    <p>
      Like all areas of research, physics-based simulation for computer animation encapsulates a core set of foundational problems. These include the simulation of smoke, water, and solids such as muscles and skin, efficient ways of controlling these simulations, and methods for dealing with their geometry. But where did these formulations come from, and how universal are they? In this talk, I will discuss their historical provenance. Far from being universal, they are highly tailored to analog-era industrial techniques from Walt Disney Animation Studios and Industrial Light and Magic. How does this then shape our perceptions, and what counts as valid research problems and solutions? I will not have many answers, but I hope to raise a few questions.

    <h3><span class=keynote-title>Structure preserving discretizations: Towards generalizations of conformal maps and circle patterns</span></h3>
    <p>
      Structure-preserving discretization in the field of geometry is the paradigm of discrete differential geometry. Here, of course, deciding which of the structures are to be taken into account is a nontrivial problem. In some aspects, the discrete theory turns out to be even richer than its smooth counterpart. It focuses on developing constructive methods, which allow one to prove natural existence and uniqueness results, as well as the corresponding convergence statements. The well-established theory of discrete conformal maps and circle patterns has already found numerous applications in geometry processing. We present their generalizations beyond the conformal limit: decorated discrete conformal maps and ring patterns, which share the corresponding existence and uniqueness statements. The theory and construction methods are based on variational principles. We also briefly explain how structure preserving discretizations recently helped to answer the long-standing question whether a surface in three-space is uniquely determined by its metric and curvatures (Bonnet problem).

<p>Geometry processing is a vital component for solving 3D shape-matching problems that have significant relevance in enabling various downstream tasks like artistic designs, CAD modeling, and medical analysis. With the advent of data-driven solutions, flexible alignment techniques have become essential tools to unleash the potential of deep learning methods. This tutorial introduces the Functional Maps paradigm, one of the main frameworks for the past decade. We will explain the main concepts of this elegant and flexible framework on graphs, and then develop the necessary tools for triangular mesh cases. We will review the crucial steps of this long-standing literature, from its inception to the advent of geometric deep learning. Additionally, we will highlight the latest and most promising research directions, giving participants a comprehensive understanding of the current state-of-the-art in this field.</p>

<p>The numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) is ubiquitous in computer graphics and engineering applications, ranging from the computation of UV maps and skinning weights to the simulation of elastic deformations, fluids, and light scattering. The finite element method (FEM) is the most commonly used discretization of PDEs due to its generality and rich selection of off-the-shelf commercial implementations. In this course, we will implement a FE solver in 1D for the Laplace equation from scratch using only Numpy. We will briefly derive the necessary theory and quickly move into live coding the solver. At the end of the course, you will have a basic applied understanding of how the FEM works and how to extend the current code to higher dimensions and more complicated physics.</p>

<p>Structures that transform from compact configurations (which are simpler to manufacture and transport) to 3D shapes with specific forms and functions have important advantages for applications like emergency shelters, temporary event spaces, medical devices, and satellite antennas. However, designing such structures is difficult, involving interesting technical challenges like controlling the highly nonlinear large-deformation behavior of elastic beam and membrane structures. This course presents computational techniques for tackling inverse design problems in this space. It will cover shape optimization using differentiable physics simulation and show various strategies for accelerating these optimization algorithms. It will also introduce two-scale design algorithms, where the low-level details of the physical system are abstracted using homogenization to obtain a coarsened design problem that can be solved robustly by traditional computer graphics techniques like surface parametrization algorithms. Then the coarsened solution is &ldquo;de-homogenized&rdquo; to a full-scale structure and fine-tuned with shape optimization.</p>

They are largely used as computational domains for the resolution of partial differential equations for physically based simulation, making them a core ingredient of many software tools used by the automobile, naval, aerospace, medical, and geological industries, as well as for many applications in Computer Graphics and Animation. In academic research and industry, the algorithmic generation and processing of hexahedral meshes have been studied for more than 30 years now. In this course, we will introduce the topic of hexahedral meshes and focus on the most relevant techniques for hexahedral mesh generation in Computer Graphics. For each technique, we will highlight capabilities and limitations, also pointing out the associated unsolved challenges. The required background, pertaining to geometrical as well as combinatorial aspects, will be introduced along the way.</p>

Beginning with the basics of explicit, implicit, and hybrid 3D scene representations, we will establish a foundation for understanding how these representations contribute to the field of 3D computer vision. We will then explore the recent evolution of hybrid implicit-explicit 3D representations in 3D reconstruction, neural rendering, and visual SLAM, discussing seminal works that have significantly advanced the state-of-the-art. In light of the recent hype surrounding ChatGPT, we will also briefly examine how large language models can be combined with implicit and explicit representations to enable new possibilities and innovative solutions in computer vision research</p>

<p>Surface reconstruction from raw and imperfect inputs often results in shapes containing unwanted topological features, such as islands, handles, and voids. These errors are detrimental to downstream geometric processing tasks such as simplification, parameterization, and simulation. Topological errors can either be removed after the shape has been reconstructed (known as topological repair) or prevented during reconstruction by imposing topological constraints. This course will introduce fundamental concepts of topology that are relevant to surface reconstruction, review existing methods for topology repair and topology-constrained reconstruction, and describe several selected methods in detail. The course will end with a discussion of open problems in this area that await future research.</p>

<p>The recent popularity of neural implicit surfaces has renewed interest in implicit representations of geometry. In this session, we will dive into the world of implicit surfaces, both classical and neural. First, we will look at the use of implicit surfaces in surface reconstruction from point clouds. We will explore how a classical method, Poisson surface reconstruction, has recently been reinterpreted in a Gaussian process framework. Then we will take a look at recent neural implicit methods for surface reconstruction and the architecture and regularization choices they make. We will take a brief detour to look at NeRF and its descendants and their relationship to neural implicit models. The success of neural implicit representations has driven an interest in building a complete geometry processing pipeline around these representations. We will look at some attempts in this direction and conclude with some reflections about the future of the field.</p>

The goal of this course will be to highlight some of these recent advances and to make connections between their underlying algorithms to related methods in geometry processing. After a brief primer on proteins and the significance of their 3D structures (assuming no prior knowledge of biology), I will overview two complementary research thrusts:</p>
<ol>
<li>• protein structure prediction (e.g. AlphaFold) and</li>
<li>• protein structure determination via 3D reconstruction of cryo-electron microscopy images.</li>
</ol>
<p>Topics will include structured transformers for 3D data and implicit neural representations, respectively. A desired outcome will be to convey the unique, multimodal challenges in this highly interdisciplinary area.</p>
