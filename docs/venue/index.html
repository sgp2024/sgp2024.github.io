**[Registration for the Conference and Graduate School will open soon.](https://sgp2024.github.io/)**

**[SGP&#39;24 Program is in preparation.](/program)**
___

SGP is the premier venue for disseminating new research ideas and cutting-edge results in geometry processing. In this research area, concepts from mathematics, computer science, and engineering are studied and applied to offer new insights and design efficient algorithms for acquisition, modeling, analysis, manipulation, simulation and other types of processing of 3D models and shape collections.

Continuing a successful tradition from previous years, SGP will also offer a Graduate School, targeted at students and researchers new to the field. Courses will be taught by leading experts and complemented by interactive demonstrations to provide in-depth knowledge of recent and fundamental aspects of geometry processing.
___

**The SGP will be located at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA.**

      <p>The venue for SGP is the Stata Center, home of the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.  The Stata Center is designed by renowned architect Frank Gehry, whose other structures include the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, the Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, and the Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris, France. The 720,000-square-foot design is a whimsical mesh of modern and quirky, with shiny tilting towers and angled walls, an ideal space for a conference whose focuses include architectural geometry. Stata includes a 350-seat auditorium with filming capabilities suitable for recording SGP talks, as well as the Charles Vest Student Street, with ample seating, open space, regular fairs and events, and the Forbes Family Cafe, a 220-seat dining facility for breakfast and lunch. </p>
