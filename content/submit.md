-  Geometry and topology data structures and representations
-  Exploration of shape collections
-  Geometry compression
-  Geometric deep learning

-  Surface and volume parameterization and deformation


### Typesetting

Please format your article using the template for SGP available on the SRMv2 website: https://srmv2.eg.org. SGP does not impose a strict maximum length for submitted papers. However, Computer Graphics Forum and SGP recommend that research papers be up to 10 pages (including all images, but excluding references). Papers should only be as long as their content would justify. Reviewers might rate a submission lower if it is perceived as being unnecessarily long. Authors are encouraged to use supplementary documents to provide extra content.

### Anonymization

Review is based on a [dual-anonymous](https://www.acm.org/diversity-inclusion/words-matter) reviewing process: submission authors do not know the identity of their reviewers and reviewers do not know the identity of submission authors (or each other).  All submitted papers must be anonymized. Please be sure to remove all personal data (such as authors, affiliations, etc.) from your submission.  References to your own work should be made in the third person. Reviewers are asked to keep confidentiality on all materials sent to them for evaluation.

### Submitting your article

Articles must be submitted, in electronic pdf format, using the Submission and Review Management (SRMv2) system.

### (Recommended) Abstract submission

In order for a paper to be considered for publication, a corresponding abstract must be submitted. Although the abstract submission deadline (see timeline above) is not mandatory and will not prevent a full paper submission, it is strongly encouraged to abide by it, to help assign relevant reviewers (paper bidding done on the abstract provided by the abstract deadline).

### Reviewing process

Submitted papers undergo a two-stage review process, involving dual-anonymous assessment by carefully selected reviewers from the [technical papers committee](/organization/#technical-papers-committee). Articles are conditionally accepted after the first round. Final acceptance is determined in the second round, based on the revised version of the article.

### Anonymity and Preprints 

We are adopting the same policy as SIGGRAPH (which is similar to CVPR) on preprints, including those shared via arXiv.  Following this policy almost verbatim, we recognize that prepublications and talks have become part of the scientific discourse, and SGP allows these means of communication. Specifically, before the final acceptance decision is made:

> - Authors must not discuss the research described in submitted SGP papers with the media. Media includes editors/journalists/writers/interviewers of newspapers, radio, television, magazines, as well as public relations and media arms of companies, universities, and other research institutions.
> - After submitting to SGP, authors may archive the submission without mentioning SGP as an institutional tech report or on arXiv or a similar service.
> - Authors must not make any posts to social media or elsewhere that can be linked to a specific SGP submission (e.g., mentioning the title of the submission or details and content and saying that it is a SGP submission).
> - Authors may talk about their work in a presentation without saying it is submitted to SGP.
> - Authors may mention their submission(s) as under review at SGP as part of the written materials submitted for job and funding applications. Authors may talk about the research involved in their submission in talks given for these purposes as well, without mentioning SGP.

### Proceedings
The SGP proceedings will appear as a regular electronic issue of Computer Graphics Forum, the International Journal of the EUROGRAPHICS Association. The journal status of the proceedings requires a two-stage review process with conditional acceptance after the first round and final acceptance based on the revised submissions.

<!--
Accepted papers will be published in a regular issue of _Computer Graphics
Forum_, the International Journal of the EUROGRAPHICS Association. _Computer
Graphics Forum_ (Print ISSN: 0167-7055; Online ISSN: 1467-8659) is the official
journal of _Eurographics_, published in cooperation with Wiley-Blackwell, and is
one of the leading journals for researchers, developers and users of Computer
Graphics in both commercial and academic environment. It has one of the highest
impact factors in the field, and it is indexed by all major databases;
additionally, the electronic version of all accepted work will also be indexed
and accessible by the EG Digital Library.
-->
### Awards and Recognitions

Following its traditions, SGP 2024 will attribute three best paper awards, a software award recognising the authors of an open-source software that has greatly influenced the field, and a data set award designed to acknowledge the suppliers of high quality datasets used in geometry processing. In addition, SGP may provide papers with the reproducibility stamp to recognise the effort of researchers who, in addition to publishing their paper at SGP 2024, provide a complete open-source implementation of their algorithm.
 
Please send nominations to awardnominations@geometryprocessing.org

## Instructions for Oral Presentations

Technical Papers will be presented as pre-recorded videos (15-16 min) broadcasted live followed by a short live Q&A session (4-5 min).

You are free to record the video in the manner you find best, we require however that the video starts with a title slide using the SGP 2021 Presentation Templates below.

Please send a youtube link to chairs-sgp2021@eg.org before **Thursday July 8th PM 23:59 UTC**. Videos will be gathered in a youtube playlist and made public after the conference, hence please do not include content that cannot be distributed (e.g., copyrighted photos or music).

## SGP 2021 Presentation Templates

Presenters are invited to use the following official SGP 2021 slide templates:

- [Powerpoint](/sgp2021-template.potx)

### Poster Presentation

At least one author of each accepted poster is expected to be present at the SGP 2024 conference to discuss their work during the dedicated poster session. Authors will be in charge of printing the poster, many printing services are available around the conference venue. Posters will be displayed throughout the conference, and authors will have the opportunity to present their work and engage with attendees.

We look forward to your contributions and to an engaging and informative poster session at SGP 2024!
